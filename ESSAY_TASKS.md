# ESSAY_TASKS: Lair Dramatic Presentation Scorer

This document defines the evaluation tasks for the Lair Dramatic Presentation Scorer function. Each task evaluates a specific quality within the four dimensions of theatrical lair potential. Tasks are organized by dimension, with each dimension weighted at 25% of the final score.

---

## Dimension 1: Architectural Grandeur (25%)

### Task 1.1: Scale and Intimidation

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether the location's structures create a sense of imposing scale that makes humans feel appropriately small and overwhelmed.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Vertical drama: towers, spires, vaulted ceilings, multi-level throne rooms, observation decks
- Horizontal expanse: vast halls, endless corridors, sprawling control rooms
- Scale relative to human form: Do structures dwarf human figures?
- Structural drama: cantilevered platforms, spiral staircases, bridges over abysses
- Material language: Does the construction communicate power? (brutalist concrete, Gothic stone, gleaming chrome, ancient basalt)

**Response Scale**:
- Overwhelming scale: Structures create profound sense of human insignificance; architecture actively intimidates
- Impressive scale: Notable grandeur that commands respect; visitor feels appropriately diminished
- Moderate scale: Some imposing elements present but not consistently overwhelming
- Unremarkable scale: Standard proportions; nothing makes visitors feel small
- Diminutive scale: Structures are actively cozy, welcoming, or cramped; anti-intimidating

### Task 1.2: Natural Feature Integration

**Purpose**: Evaluate how well the location merges with dramatic natural features, creating a sense that the lair belongs inevitably to its environment.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Volcanic integration: throne rooms overlooking calderas, lava flows as architectural features
- Aquatic integration: entrances behind waterfalls, structures rising from the sea, underwater chambers
- Geological integration: carved from cliffs, embedded in glaciers, grown from crystal caves
- Atmospheric integration: buildings that capture storms, channel winds, collect lightning
- Organic integration: structures merged with ancient trees, coral formations, or living rock

**Response Scale**:
- Masterful integration: Location and natural feature are inseparable; the lair seems to have grown from the landscape
- Strong integration: Dramatic natural features are incorporated into the location's identity
- Moderate integration: Some natural drama present but not fully exploited or merged
- Minimal integration: Natural environment exists nearby but is essentially separate from the location
- No integration: Location ignores or actively conflicts with its natural surroundings

### Task 1.3: Ceremonial Space Potential

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether the location can support the ceremonial needs of proper villainy: throne rooms, command centers, audience chambers, and private sanctums.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Throne room potential: spaces with sight lines that draw attention to a focal point; dramatic seating positions
- Command center potential: areas suitable for banks of monitors, holographic displays, or scrying pools
- Audience chamber potential: spaces where minions could assemble to receive pronouncements

- Transition spaces: dramatic corridors, grand staircases, and processional routes

**Response Scale**:
- Exceptional ceremonial potential: Multiple spaces perfectly suited for all villainous ceremonial needs
- Strong ceremonial potential: Clear spaces for most ceremonial functions; only minor adaptation needed
- Moderate ceremonial potential: Some ceremonial uses possible with effort; core spaces exist

## Task Weighting Summary

Each dimension contributes 25% to the final score:

- **Dimension 1 (Architectural Grandeur)**: Average of Tasks 1.1-1.4
- **Dimension 2 (Atmospheric Quality)**: Average of Tasks 2.1-2.4
- **Dimension 3 (Symbolic Resonance)**: Average of Tasks 3.1-3.4
- **Dimension 4 (Monologue Backdrop Quality)**: Average of Tasks 4.1-4.4

The holistic task (5.1) serves as a calibration check and can be used to adjust edge cases where the dimensional scores don't capture the gestalt appropriately.

Final Score = (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4) / 4, potentially adjusted by holistic assessment for outlier cases.
